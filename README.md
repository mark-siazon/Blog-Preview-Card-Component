### What I learned:

Recap over some of the major learnings while working through this project:

#### General things I've learned:

- Review of HTML & CSS, CSS Flex Layout
- Accurately replicate Figma Design to Code
- Make use of SASS to make much more clean and organized styles
- Dynamic class that has the same style to avoid redundancy
- Less class and keep HTML Structure as simple as possible
